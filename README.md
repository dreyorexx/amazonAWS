# Amazon AWS Database + Java  
I created this repo because I felt that it was difficult to integrate AWS with Java & the help from AWS help guides didn't neccesarily work (they're mostly outdated). I ran into a lot of trouble when using AWS as my cloud solution provider in my projects, so feel free to take the codes & use them in your work. I really hope that they help you, and I've just started programming for about 6 months, so feel free to give me constructive feedback on my codes!
